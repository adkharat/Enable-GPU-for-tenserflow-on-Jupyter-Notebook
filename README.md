Enable GPU for tenserflow on Jupyter Notebook
========================================================
Pre-requisite:-

1. Your computer must have CUDA supported GPU. --> Check here --> https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
2. Download and Installed Nvidia GPU Driver --> from www.nvidia.com/drivers
3. Download and Installed Nvidia CUDA Driver from--> https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads .(around 2.5GB)
4. Download CUDnn.--> Extract it.--> It contain 3 folder and 1 file from--> https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads . -->login with Google account.
5. Copy all content(3 folder and 1 file) from CUDnn to --> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\   location.




Note:-
NVIDIA cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks.
Make sure version of CUDA and CUDnn must be same.
